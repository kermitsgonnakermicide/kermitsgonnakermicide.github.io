Hi, I'm Daksh and I like to work with robots and other fun computer-related things. I've dabbled in a ton of different fields, from app development to web development to PCB design, 3D Printing, CAD, LEGO Robotics, Microcontrollers and MATLAB and so so much more. I'm interested in working on new and emerging technologies, especially in the robotics space. Currently, I'm in Grade 10(thats sophomore year) at Shiv Nadar School and I'm based in the Delhi-NCR area. I'm excited to work on cool robotics projects in the future!
